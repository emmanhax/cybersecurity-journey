# 🧠 C Programming Journey

This folder tracks my progress with C programming, starting from coursework in Fall 2024 and continuing into more advanced material in future semesters.

## 📂 Structure

- 'fall-2024/' - Archived early class projects and practice
- 'upcoming/' - Placeholder for future system level C work

## 🛠️ Areas of Focus

- Memory management and pointers
- C data structures
- File I/O and system calls
- Multi-file project structure

I'll continue to update this as I build out more complex programs and refine my efficiency in C.
