# ðŸ“˜ Google Cybersecurity Certificate Notes

This folder contains my personal notes from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Topics include: 

- Cybersecurity fundementals
- Networking and Linux
- Security tools and techniques
- Threat Analysis
- Risk management and incident response

I'm documenting these for revision, review, and sharing with others on the same path.
